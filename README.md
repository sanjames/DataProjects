List of Data Projects done

1) Kaggle Project Movie Database: https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
This dataset has information from The Movie Database (TMDb). It has the files:
tmdb_5000_credits.csv - Movie credits data
tmdb_5000_movies.csv - Movie metadata
The focus of this project is to figure our the success of the movie before it is released. Will we be able to predict the success rate of the movie? Will we be able to predict whether the movie will be a box office hit, get more revenue etc. Is there any magic formula for the success of the movie???
